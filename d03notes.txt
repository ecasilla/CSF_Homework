Plain vanilla Arrays in java are obj

Arrays String[] array = new String[ 0 "size"];

When you create a the size is fixed if you want to add something to it you have to copy everthing over into a new Array

after we create an array all we have to keep track of is the first address in memory and then all we need to add is the element in the array to access it

int i = array[0];
array[0] = 1;

int length = array.length;

array.length is not how many items are in the array but the size of the array

Array List is an array list that is backed by an Array
ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList();

In an ArrayList you cant store and primitive type you need to wrap it in an object in order to push it on to the array
